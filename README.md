# Pwalk Reporter

## What is Pwalk Reporter

The pwalk_reporter utility takes the output from the [pwalk](https://github.com/fizwit/filesystem-reporting-tools) utility and provides summary statistics about the filesystem.

It provides the following summary statistics:

- Total file count and total file size of the filesystem
- A histogram of file ages broken down by file count and size in a fixed set of bins. The histogram can use either 'mtime' (default) or 'atime' I plan to make the histogram bins either automatic or provide the ability to specify them in a future release.
- The top 100 file types by total size
- The top 100 largest directories by size

## Usage

After you have the output from [pwalk](https://github.com/fizwit/filesystem-reporting-tools) that you want to summarize (named "filesystem.csv in example below) you simply provde the input file as the parameter and direct the output to a file (named "outputfile.csv in the example).  Basic usage of the utility is shown below:

```bash
pwalk_reporter inputfile.csv > outputfile.csv
```
There are to optional parameters:

- **atime** - switch from using 'mtime' (default) to 'atime' for the file age histogram.
- **offsetdays** \<int\> - if the pwalk output you are working with is not fresh, you can provide a number of days of offset so the histogram fits the dataset

In the example below we want to report on 'atime' and provide summary stats for a 14 day old pwalk dataset:

```bash
pwalk_reporter --atime --offsetdays 14 inputfile.csv > outputfile.csv
```
The output of pwalk reporter looks like the following:

```

The pwalk_reporter runs fairly quickly, the output about was from a 181 million row dataset (file and directories) and was processed in about 18 minutes; a rate around 170K rows per second.
